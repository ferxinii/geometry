/*
 * Filename:
 *     convhull_3d.h
 * Description:
 *     A header only C implementation of the 3-D quickhull algorithm.
 *     The code is largely derived from the "computational-geometry-toolbox"
 *     by George Papazafeiropoulos (c) 2014, originally distributed under
 *     the BSD (2-clause) license.
 *     To include this implementation in a project, simply add this:
 *         #define CONVHULL_3D_ENABLE
 *         #include "convhull_3d.h"
 *     By default, the algorithm uses double floating point precision. To
 *     use single precision (less accurate but quicker), also add this:
 *         #define CONVHULL_3D_USE_SINGLE_PRECISION
 *     If your project has CBLAS linked, then you can also speed things up
 *     a tad by adding this:
 *         #define CONVHULL_3D_USE_CBLAS
 *     The code is C++ compiler safe.
 *     Reference: "The Quickhull Algorithm for Convex Hull, C. Bradford
 *                 Barber, David P. Dobkin and Hannu Huhdanpaa, Geometry
 *                 Center Technical Report GCG53, July 30, 1993"
 * Dependencies:
 *     cblas (optional for speed ups, especially for very large meshes)
 *     (Available in e.g. Apple Accelerate Framework, or Intel MKL)
 * Author, date created:
 *     Leo McCormack, 02.10.2017
